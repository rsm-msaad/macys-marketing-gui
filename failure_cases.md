# Predicted Failure Cases

List **at least 5 realistic ways** your AI coworker or workflow could
fail. Focus on practical failures, not abstract risks.

Examples to draw from:

- Missing data
- Conflicting sources
- Wrong document retrieved
- Incorrect classification
- Bad recommendation
- Output is too generic
- User skips review
- Tool or API fails
- AI produces a result that looks polished but is not supported by evidence
- The process is faster but less accurate

| Failure case | Why it might happen | Business consequence | How the user would notice | How your process handles it |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| *(add row 1)* | | | | |
| *(add row 2)* | | | | |
| *(add row 3)* | | | | |
| Localization (Step 7) | Localization Manager | Reviews translations and regional pricing | Approves or requests re-generation | Must lock in before activation fires | Regional copy checked against style guide | | | | |
| *(add row 5)* | | | | |

At least **2 of these failures** should be the ones you specifically
test against in `tests/test_workflow.py` (see `tests/README.md`).
