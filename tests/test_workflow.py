"""DeepEval AI-performance tests for the M04 workflow.

This is a *starter* — it shows the shape of one case and the four
required checks (faithfulness, answer relevancy, quality rule, face
validity) so you can run `uv run pytest -m integration
tests/test_workflow.py` and see results. Replace the placeholder case
with 8-12 real cases drawn from your workflow, and tailor the
``QualityRule`` and ``FaceValidity`` criteria to your business context.
See `tests/README.md` for the full pattern.

The suite is marked ``integration`` because it makes real LLM calls
(both for the workflow under test and for DeepEval's judge model), so it
is skipped by default. Run explicitly:

    uv run pytest -m integration tests/test_workflow.py

Results land in ``tests/results/``; summarize them in ``test_report.md``.
