# Milestone 02

Push all deliverables to GitHub before the start of class on **May 7th**. Make sure to have the required folders and files starting from the base provided in this repo. GitHub will run automated check to ensure each file is available.

- README.md
- `data/` Contains data and code for data preparation
- `skill/` Contains the _skills_ you create for your project

## Human in the Loop Architecture

Our project follows the architecture Vincent laid out on Piazza. Skills are markdown first, with Python scripts handling every calculation. The LLM never computes results. It reads the brief, picks the right script to run, and surfaces the output for review. Humans stay in the loop at every strategic decision point.

Each of the four skills we shipped pairs AI work with a specific human owner who makes the final call:

| Skill | Workflow Step | AI Does | Human Decides |
|-------|---------------|---------|---------------|
| Audience Segment Builder | Step 2: Segmentation | Generates 3 ranked segment options using RFM clustering | Sarah picks which segment to target based on business context |
| DAM Asset Finder | Steps 4 to 5: Creative Production | Filters degraded assets, ranks clean ones by relevance | Priya picks the final hero photos for the campaign |
| Localization Generator | Step 7: Localization | Generates 40 regional variants with pricing and copy substitutions | Diego reviews variants, flags edge cases, approves the batch |
| Campaign Performance Analyzer | Step 9: Monitoring | Pulls data, runs attribution, forecasts next campaign | Anna adds business context to the auto-generated readout before sending to leadership |

### Deterministic automations (not skills)

Other pieces of the workflow are pure automation. They run on a schedule, they make no business judgment, and they get no benefit from an LLM in the loop:

- Star Rewards data export (daily customer data sync, cron job)
- File format conversion (PSD to JPG, PNG, MP4, deterministic)
- Regional pricing sync (data join across systems, no judgment needed)

These are intentionally not skills. They run as scheduled scripts because they don't benefit from AI judgment. This is the deterministic automation improvement path Vincent mentioned in his Piazza clarification.

## Claude usage logging

> **Heads up:** Your Claude Code usage in this repo is logged. Prompts you submit and the tools Claude runs are written to `.claude/usage-log/<username>-session-*.jsonl` and auto-staged on every `git commit`, so they end up on GitHub alongside your code. This repo lives in a **private GitHub organization** — only you, your teammates, and the instructional team can see it. The instructor uses these logs to see how the class is using the tool — please work normally and know that **file contents and command output are not captured**, only prompts and tool names/arguments. Details in [`.claude/usage-log/README.md`](.claude/usage-log/README.md).

## How to use Claude for milestone 02 (even if you're new to coding)

Claude Code is your coding partner for this assignment. **Describe what you want in plain English** — Claude writes the code, runs the tests, and tells you if something looks wrong. You don't have to remember any commands; the helpers below cover almost every situation you'll hit.

### Two ways to ask for help

**1) Slash commands — type `/` at the start of a message.** A menu appears. Pick one and Claude does the rest.

| Command | When to use it |
| --- | --- |
| `/run-tests` | Run the project tests and see what passed or failed. |
| `/review` | You changed some code — have Claude check it before you commit. |
| `/add-function` | You need a new Python function. Claude asks four short questions, then writes the function **and** its tests in one shot. |
| `/explain <name>` | You see a file, function, or term and want it explained in plain language. Example: `/explain data/examples/1-data-simulation.qmd`. |

You can get the path to a file by right clicking on it in VS Code.

**2) Just describe your problem — some helpers switch on automatically.** You don't have to remember the names below; just type naturally and Claude will pull in the right helper.

| Say something like… | What happens |
| --- | --- |
| _"my setup is broken"_, _"ModuleNotFoundError"_, _"uv sync isn't working"_ | Claude runs a diagnostic and tells you exactly what to fix. |
| _"VS Code opened the wrong folder"_, _"Claude can't find my project"_ | Claude checks your project folder and shows how to reopen the right one. |
| _"how do I push?"_, _"I have a merge conflict"_, _"my push was rejected"_ | Claude prints your git status and walks you through the correct commands. |

### A suggested path through milestone 02

**Before every work session.** Ask:
> _"Please confirm my workspace and Python environment are set up correctly."_

If anything fails, follow the one-line fix Claude prints.

**Deliverable 1 — data preparation (due April 30).**

1. Open the three tutorial files in [`data/examples/`](data/examples/). They show how to simulate data end-to-end with `numpy`, `polars`, and `plotnine`:
   - `1-data-simulation.qmd` — simulate a numeric dataset
   - `2-llm_persona_simulation.qmd` — use an LLM to generate realistic customer personas
   - `3-llm-dialog-simulation.qmd` — simulate conversation transcripts
2. Pick the closest one to your project and ask:
   > _"Walk me through `data/examples/1-data-simulation.qmd` step by step."_
3. Start your own file under `data/` (e.g., `data/orders.qmd`). Tell Claude:
   > _"Help me simulate weekly customer orders for the process in my Milestone 01 workflow. Use `data/examples/1-data-simulation.qmd` as a template."_
4. Update [`data/README.md`](data/README.md) with a one-line description of each dataset you create.

**Deliverable 2 — build at least four skills (due May 7). At least two must include analytics** (charts, forecasting, statistics, etc.).

1. Open [`skills/example/`](skills/example/) — it's a complete working skill you'll copy the layout from (`SKILL.md`, `scripts/`, `install.sh`, `README.qmd`, plus tests under `tests/skills/`). Ask:
   > _"Explain how `skills/example` works."_
2. For each of your four skills, pick one task from your Milestone 01 workflow and ask:
   > _"Help me build a skill that does `<task>`. Use `skills/example/` as the template."_
3. Review the draft with `/review`, then run the tests with `/run-tests`.
4. Once a skill is finished, install it so Claude can use it on the next session:

   ```bash
   bash skills/<your-skill-name>/install.sh
   ```

**Deliverable 3 — the top-level `README.md` (due May 7).** After your skills exist, ask:
> _"Draft a milestone 02 README that maps each Milestone 01 workflow task to the skill that addresses it, the dataset it uses, and the Python functions involved."_

Then edit the result in your own words so it sounds like your team.

**Deliverable 4 — 10-minute demo video (due May 7).** Nothing to type here. Record your team walking through each skill live with Claude, showing realistic inputs and outputs. Re-run every skill at least once before recording so nothing surprises you on camera.

**At the end of every work session.** Ask:
> _"Please commit my changes with a short message and push to GitHub."_

If the push is rejected (e.g., a teammate pushed first), just say _"my push failed, help"_ — Claude will pull up the git helper and walk you through it safely.

### Where to find working examples in this repo

- [`data/examples/`](data/examples/) — three tutorial Quarto (`.qmd`) files showing data simulation end-to-end with `numpy` + `polars` + `plotnine`.
- [`skills/example/`](skills/example/) — a complete sample skill. Mirror its layout for every skill you build.
- [`CLAUDE.md`](CLAUDE.md) — rules Claude already follows automatically (use `uv` for packages, every function needs tests, never use pandas/matplotlib). You don't have to read it, but it explains why Claude makes certain choices.

## Content

This repo contains some examples and settings to help you get started:

- `.claude/settings.json` — tells Claude what it can and can't do without asking for explicit permission
- `.claude/hooks/` — small scripts that run at key moments (auto-format, lint reminder, stale-test reminder, secret scanning, usage logging)
- `.claude/commands/` — project-local slash commands (`/run-tests`, `/review`, `/add-function`, `/explain`)
- `CLAUDE.md` — rules Claude reads automatically on every session (uv workflow, testing requirements, etc.)

See [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZlDnsf_DOzg) for a very nice overview video about providing guidance for Claude Code. Come to the worksession to discuss or ask questions (or post to piazza)

## Hooks — automatic helpers

A *hook* is a small script that Claude Code runs for you automatically at certain moments — you don't have to remember to call them. Think of them like the spell-checker in a word processor: it just runs in the background and catches mistakes before they cause trouble. The hooks configured in this repo are:

- **After Claude edits a Python file** → `ruff` formats it. Your code ends up tidy (correct spacing, quotes, etc.) without you learning the style rules first.
- **After you run `pytest`** → a timestamp is saved so Claude knows when tests were last green.
- **When Claude finishes its turn** → two soft reminders appear if (a) Python files changed since the last test run, or (b) `ruff` found any lint issues. Nothing is blocked — they're nudges.
- **Before every `git commit`** → the commit is paused if any staged file looks like a secret (`.env`, API keys, private keys, …). You'll get a prompt asking if you really want to proceed.
- **On every prompt you send and every tool Claude runs** → a short entry is appended to `.claude/usage-log/` for instructor review (see the Claude usage logging section above).

You don't need to run any of these yourself. They live in `.claude/hooks/` if you want to peek.

## Version control with git (and Claude's `/rewind`)

Version control = a time machine for your files. Every time you *commit*, git takes a snapshot of your whole project. If something later breaks, you can go back to any earlier snapshot.

### The basic loop

Whenever you finish something that works (even partly), ask Claude to commit:

> *"Commit these changes with a short message describing what we just did."*

Claude will run these commands for you:

- `git status` — shows which files changed
- `git add <files>` — marks files to include in the next snapshot
- `git commit -m "…"` — takes the snapshot with a message describing it

When you're done for the day, ask Claude to **push** — this uploads your commits to GitHub so they're backed up and your instructor/teammates can see them:

> *"Push my commits to GitHub."*

### Two different "rewind" tools — know which one you need

You have **two different ways to undo work**, and they do different things. Pick the right one.

| If you want to undo… | Use | What it does |
| --- | --- | --- |
| The last few things Claude said/did in *this conversation* | `/rewind` in Claude Code | Rolls the conversation back to an earlier message. Files Claude edited are restored to how they were at that point. Nothing is committed either way. |
| Code changes that are already committed to git | `git checkout <commit>` or "revert" | Uses git snapshots to bring back an older version of a file or the whole repo. Works even across sessions, days later, on any computer. |

**`/rewind`** is like hitting "Back" in a browser — great for "wait, that last edit was wrong, take it back." Type `/rewind` in the Claude Code prompt and pick the message to return to.

**Git commits** are the real safety net. `/rewind` only remembers the current conversation; if you close Claude Code or start a new session, that history is gone. Commits last forever.

### Rule of thumb

- **Commit often.** After every small piece of working progress — not just at the end. Five small commits beat one giant commit.
- **Push at the end of each work session** so your work is safely on GitHub.
- **Use `/rewind` for "oops" during the current conversation**; use git to recover from anything older than that.
- **Don't panic if something breaks.** Between `/rewind` and your git history, you can almost always get back to a working state. Ask Claude for help restoring if you're unsure.
